      <title>Donation Fundraising Marketing Campaign Analysis</title>
      <link>/project3/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project3/</guid>
      <description>Overview: This project revolves around predicting individual donation likelihood and anticipated donation amounts (in €) for a charity fundraising campaign (&amp;ldquo;SJ22&amp;rdquo;). By amalgamating these predictions, the aim is to estimate the expected revenue for each individual. The core strategy involves recommending solicitation to potential donors only if the projected revenue exceeds the solicitation cost (2.00 €), ensuring a positive profit margin. Conversely, if the projected revenue falls short, the recommendation is to avoid solicitation to prevent a net loss.</description>

      <guid>/project5/</guid>
      <description>Overview: The project focuses on link prediction within an actor co-occurrence network, where nodes represent actors and edges indicate co-occurrence on the same Wikipedia page. Leveraging both graph structure and node attribute features, the objective is to predict missing or future edges using machine learning models. The dataset consisted a directed graph comprising 10k node pairs, where edges denote co-occurrence on the same Wikipedia page.&#xA;Methodology: Graph Creation: Populated an empty graph with nodes from node features, establishing actor relationships and facilitating powerful embeddings representing Wikipedia page subjects and environments.</description>

      <guid>/project6/</guid>
      <description>Objective: The project aimed to develop a semantic image segmentation model leveraging remotely sensed data post-Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. The focus was on accurately identifying common assets in residential areas by segmenting high-resolution photographs captured by a small UAV. The dataset consisted of 299 images with dense segmentation masks containing 27 classes like Property Roof, Swimming Pool, Vehicle, etc.&#xA;Methodology: Data Augmentation: Enhanced dataset quality using image augmentations: horizontal flip, brightness/contrast/color adjustments, blurring, sharpening, Gaussian noise, and normalization.</description>

      <guid>/project9/</guid>
      <description>Overview: The challenge at hand involved identifying and localizing methane leaks in the atmosphere using a dataset comprising 64x64 grayscale satellite images from diverse locations. The primary goal was to develop a robust deep learning model capable of accurately discerning whether a specific location exhibits a methane plume or not. This was a team effort along with other contributors including Congjie AN, Vanshika Jain, Oluwafisayomi BADARU, Tunç EREN and Corentin DELLOYE.</description>
